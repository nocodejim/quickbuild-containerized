How to Use an Agentic AI to Build This ProjectThis guide provides best practices for using an agentic AI like GitHub Copilot (in agent mode with Claude 4) to build the QuickBuild project. The key is to provide clear, comprehensive instructions.The "Master Prompt" StrategyThe most effective way to guide the AI is to give it a complete plan. The README.md file in this project is designed to be that "master prompt." It contains everything the AI needs to know: the goal, the file structure, and the exact content of every file.Recommended WorkflowStart a New Session: Begin a new chat session with your AI agent to ensure there's no conflicting context from previous conversations.Provide the Master Prompt: Your first instruction to the agent should be to read and understand the master plan.Initial Prompt Example:"Hello. I need you to build a containerized QuickBuild environment. I have a complete plan and all the required code in a README.md file. Please read the README.md in my workspace first. Your task is to create the directory structure and all the files exactly as specified in that document. Do not start writing any code until you have reviewed the entire README.md."Let the Agent Work: The agent should now:Acknowledge the plan.Create the server/ and agent/ directories.Create each file (docker-compose.yml, server/Dockerfile, etc.) and populate it with the exact content from the README.md.Verify the Output: After the agent reports that it has completed the task, review the generated files. Because the README.md was so specific, there should be very few errors.Avoid Vague Instructions: Do not start with a vague prompt like "Create a Docker setup for QuickBuild." This gives the AI too much freedom and can lead to unpredictable results. By providing the complete solution upfront in the README.md, you are using the AI as a powerful automation tool rather than a speculative creator.Key Principles for SuccessBe Explicit: The README.md is highly explicit, which is the most important technique. It tells the AI exactly what to do.Context is King: By telling the agent to read the file first, you are providing all the necessary context in one go.Break Down the Problem: The README.md naturally breaks down the problem into a file-by-file structure, which is an easy-to-follow plan for the agent.By following this approach, you are leveraging the agent's ability to execute a detailed plan, which is a more reliable and efficient way to use current agentic AI technology.
